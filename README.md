# Minecraft Mod Showcase & Voting

Welcome to showcase for our Minecraft Modpack. 
I have been testing out different mods and have put together as many interesting mods. In the end, I will advise and put together the modpack based on compatibility.

## ✅ How to Vote

Each mod is posted as an **issue** in this repo. To vote:

1. Click on the **Issues** tab above
2. Open an issue (each one is a mod)
3. Click the 👍 **thumbs-up reaction** on the first comment to vote for it!

> You can vote for as many mods as you like. No need to sign in if you already have a GitHub account.
